    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">This game was created for the second year of the developer's BSc (Hons) in Computer
      Science. The idea behind
      the game was greatly inspired by the paper game dots and boxes. After coming across the paper version a year ago,
      the developer decided to make it a reality in online form. <br>It is an abstract problem solving stategy game in
      which
      the player must claim boxes in grids of varying sizes.<br> This offers complexity and a great challenge to people
      who love problem solving.</p>
