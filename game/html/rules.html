      <p class="about">The game starts by selecting lines anywhere from a point to a neighbouring point on a 5 by 5 grid
        of dots, in turns, against a computer or another player until you are able to draw the fourth, closing 3 lines
        and
        creating a square.<br> Drawing the fourth line of a square makes the possession of the box yours and will result
        in a point being added, and allows for the player to be able to draw an extra line. The end goal of the game is
        to
        take ownership of the board and can only be done once all possible lines have been filled or the board is
        complete. <br> The player with the most points wins as they have the most boxes under their possession.
